** About

- Vasilij Schneidermann, 26
- Software developer, bevuta IT GmbH
- mail@vasilij.de
- https://github.com/wasamasa
- Played a few CTFs and helped organizing one
- Chanop on =#wargames= at OverTheWire IRC network

** What is a CTF?

- Hacker contest
- Task: Capturing flags for points
- Timeboxed
- Competitive

** Why should I care?

- It's fun
- +Mess+ compete with the best
- Great learning opportunity
- Entry gateway to the infosec world

** How do they look like?

- Attack and Defense
  - Defend your own boxes, attack other boxes
  - Not as popular, requires admin skills
- Jeopardy
  - Many tasks that can be completed independently
  - Categorized into web/pwn/rev/forensic/stego/crypto/misc/...
  - Very popular

** Where/when do they happen?

- All over the world
- Often it's online
- Sometimes it's local or requires admission
- https://ctftime.org

** What stuff do they do at a Jeopardy event?

- Web
- Binary Exploitation
- Reverse Engineering
- Forensics
- Steganography
- Cryptography
- Miscellaneous

** What do they do during a Jeopardy event?

- Register user/team
- Solve challenges and submit flags
- Report bugs

** What do they do after a Jeopardy event?

- Figure out how challenge XYZ was supposed to work
- Celebrate
- Vote on https://ctftime.org
- Publish writeups
- Look for the next CTF to compete in

** How do I learn this stuff?

- Learn basics (your OS, programming, ...)
- Online labs (wargames, <http://wechall.net>)
- Set up a lab (<https://vulnhub.net>)
- Play an entry-level or highschool CTF
- Learn from your mistakes
- Study writeups

** Web

- Learn to use your browser effectively
- Intercepting proxy (Burp)
- OWASP Top 10
- OverTheWire: Natas
- WebGoat
- Random stuff found on <https://vulnhub.net>

** Binary Exploitation

- Classic Phrack articles
- [Jon Erickson] Hacking: The Art of Exploitation
- LiveOverflow YouTube channel
- https://microcorruption.com
- OverTheWire (everything after Bandit/Natas/Krypton/Leviathan)
- http://io.netgarage.org/
- http://smashthestack.org/

** Reverse Engineering

- Know your OS and toolchain (binutils) well
- Learn IDA/Ghidra/Hopper/Binary Ninja/radare2
- [Dennis Yurichev] Reverse Engineering for Beginners
- =angr= is pretty cool

** Forensics

- It's either packet analyzer captures or (broken) file systems
- Learn Wireshark
- =binwalk= is OK for carving
- radare2 was originally developed for this purpose

** Steganography

- Lots of guessing
- Common tools:
  - =strings=
  - =binwalk=
  - =exiftool=
  - =steghide=
  - =zsteg=

** Cryptography

- https://cryptopals.com
- Lots of RSA/ECC/linear algebra
- Some (sage) math may be required
- Sometimes they just throw classic ciphers at you...

** Miscellaneous

- Programming challenges (typically involving the network)
- Knowing trivia about your OS/toolchain
- Be ready for anything
